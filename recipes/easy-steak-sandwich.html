            <p class="recipe-desc">This steak sandwich recipe is as good as the takeout sub shops of Southeastern
                Massachusetts!
                I think this is about as close as you can get at home. Freezing the steak the day before makes it easy
                to
                cut
                into very thin slices.</p>

            <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
                <li>¼ medium onion, sliced</li>
                <li>4 large fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
                <li>¼ green bell pepper, sliced into long strips</li>
                <li>1 (1/2 pound) well-marbled beef steak of any type, sliced as thinly as possible</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons chopped pickled hot peppers</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 slices sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>⅓ French baguette, cut in half lengthwise</li>

            <h4 class="steps-title">Steps (5)</h4>
            <ol class="recipe-steps">
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until just
                    tender,
                    about 2 minutes. Push onion to sides of the pan; add mushrooms and cook until softened. Stir in bell
                    pepper
                    and cook just until tender, about 3 minutes. Remove vegetables from the pan with a slotted spoon;
                    set
                    aside.
                </li>
                <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet. Add steak and pickled hot peppers; season
                    with
                    hot
                    pepper sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until steak is mostly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add
                    vegetable
                    mixture back into the pan; stir until heated through.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat; place cheese on top of steak and vegetable mixture so it can melt.</li>
                <li>Scoop mixture into sliced baguette; pour some of the juices on top.</li>
            </ol>
