    <h3>This steak sandwich recipe is as good as the takeout sub shops of Southeastern Massachusetts!</h3>
    <p>I think this is about as close as you can get at home. Freezing the steak the day before makes it easy to cut into very thin slices.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>¼ medium onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 large fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>¼ green bell pepper, sliced into long strips</li>
        <li>1 (1/2 pound) well-marbled beef steak of any type, sliced as thinly as possible</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped pickled hot peppers</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 slices sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ French baguette, cut in half lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps (5)</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until just tender, about 2 minutes. Push onion to sides of the pan; add mushrooms and cook until softened. Stir in bell pepper and cook just until tender, about 3 minutes. Remove vegetables from the pan with a slotted spoon; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet. Add steak and pickled hot peppers; season with hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until steak is mostly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add vegetable mixture back into the pan; stir until heated through.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat; place cheese on top of steak and vegetable mixture so it can melt.</li>
        <li>Scoop mixture into sliced baguette; pour some of the juices on top.</li>
    </ol>
